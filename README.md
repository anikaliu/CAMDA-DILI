# CAMDA-DILI

- Code and results should be understandable and reproducible!
- Feel free to add more folders (e.g. in processed_data to structure it.)
- All code should point to files in this GitHub, so please adjust filepath.
- Also we should try to keep the number of files small, so if there was som data manipulation, think about whether you really need to save it as an intermediate file or can generate it on the fly. (If it is an intermediate one and you want to keep it, we could also do a Temp folder?)
