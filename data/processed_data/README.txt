Purpose: To parse ECFP4, MD, PT (+ reduced models) performance metrics and output tables containing both cross-validation (CV)
         and external test set (ET) for RF and SVM seperately. Such tables were used to produce the 'ET' rows in Table S1 of

Data: ML model performances for CV and ET for each model type (ECFP, MD, and PT) 
Description: currently in the directory ./processed_data/Models/{model_type}" labelled as "cv_scores_FP_yscr.csv" and "ts_scores_FP_yscr.csv"
